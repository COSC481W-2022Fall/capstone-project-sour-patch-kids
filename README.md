Madeline Pochowicz: My name is Madeline! I am a Data Science and Data Analytics major with a concentration in Advance Data Analysis. I also have a minor in general business. I will be graduating this December and can't wait! I actually am a transfer from the University of Toledo where I was originally a chemical engineering major. Things I enjoy are sports, reading and doing anything outside (when it's warm). I love the Fall and watching the trees change color and I absolutely hate the cold and winter.
